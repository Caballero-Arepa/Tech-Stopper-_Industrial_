# Tech-Stopper-_Industrial_

Tech stopper is a mod that makes it practically impossible to get pass the desired era, in this case, the Industrial era. Once the Industrial era is completed, you won't be able to progress in the tech tree.

The mod doesn't change vanilla gameplay, for the exceptions of moving Biology and Electricuty out of the industrial era, and moving Railroads to it.
